# Firefox-webext-types

Typescript types for Firefox's APIs created with the idea of cross-browser interchangeability.

All the types will resemble as much as possible the currently available API types for Chrome for an easier development of native cross-browser extension.

The current types are not complete, they will be added as needed or on request. Also you can make a PR too if you want them added as long as they respect the current format used.
